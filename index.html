  <p>Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I built this page to highight some of my talents and experiences as a webdeveloper.
  I hope you enjoy the content. Please be sure there is more content on the way as this is a fairly new venture.</p>
  <p>Besides being a webdeveloper I am a Husband and Dad with a 8 year old and a 6 year old that keep me very busy.
  In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, attending my kids sports games, and flying drones and collective pitch helicopters.
  I'm also a rabid sci-fi and fantasy fan, who reads as much as I can get time too, and loves watching old and new sci-fi movies!</p>
  <p>Currently, I am taking a break from my professional life as a developer to obtain some new skills with Rutgers Boot Camp.
  I have quite a bit of experience developing client server, intranet and even a few simple internet applications. However, I feel like I'm really
  getting the training now I've wanted for so long in webapplication development and design.  I can not wait to bring my all my skills both new and old to a new company and team soon.</p>
